    "title": "LLM-Powered Interactive Infographics Generation for Enhanced Data Storytelling",
    "description": "Generating infographics often requires manual design skills and significant time investment. This process can be cumbersome, especially when dealing with large datasets that require frequent updates.",
    "motivation": "LIDA (A Tool for Automatic Generation of Grammar-Agnostic Visualizations and Infographics using Large Language Models) automates the generation of visualizations but lacks interactive capabilities for real-time adjustments. By developing an LLM-powered system that allows users to interactively generate, refine, and update infographics in real-time, we can enhance data storytelling and make it more accessible to a broader audience.",
