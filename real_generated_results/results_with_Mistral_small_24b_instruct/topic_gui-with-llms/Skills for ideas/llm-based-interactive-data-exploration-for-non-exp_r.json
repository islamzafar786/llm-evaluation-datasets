    "title": "LLM-Based Interactive Data Exploration for Non-Expert Users",
    "description": "Non-expert users often find it challenging to explore and analyze complex datasets due to a lack of technical skills. This thesis aims to develop an LLM-based interactive system that guides non-expert users through the data exploration process, providing insights and recommendations based on their queries.",
    "motivation": "Current tools for data exploration are often too complex for non-experts, limiting their ability to derive meaningful insights from data. An LLM-based system can democratize data analysis by making it accessible to a broader audience.",
