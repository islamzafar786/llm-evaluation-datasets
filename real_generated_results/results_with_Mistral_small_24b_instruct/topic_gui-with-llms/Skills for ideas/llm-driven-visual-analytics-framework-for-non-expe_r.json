    "title": "LLM-Driven Visual Analytics Framework for Non-Expert Users",
    "description": "Visual analytics often requires specialized skills in programming, data processing, and visualization tools. This expertise barrier limits the accessibility of visual analytics to non-expert users who could benefit from these tools.",
    "motivation": "LightVA (Lightweight Visual Analytics With LLM Agent-Based Task Planning and Execution) introduces an agent-based approach but still requires some level of user expertise in task planning. By developing a more intuitive, user-friendly interface that leverages LLMs to automate the entire process from data input to visualization generation, we can democratize visual analytics for non-expert users.",
