    "title": "Multilingual LLM Interface for Enhanced Data Exploration",
    "description": "Current LLM interfaces are often limited to a single language, which restricts their usability in multilingual environments. This limitation hinders the ability of users who speak different languages to effectively explore and analyze data.",
    "motivation": "The Applied Hedge Algebra Approach with Multilingual Large Language Models (Applied Hedge Algebra Approach with Multilingual Large Language Models to Extract Hidden Rules in Datasets for Improvement of Generative AI Applications) demonstrates the potential of multilingual LLMs but focuses on rule extraction rather than data exploration. By developing a multilingual LLM interface that supports natural language queries and visualizations in multiple languages, we can make data exploration more accessible to a global audience.",
    "questions": [
      "How can a multilingual interface for large language models (LLMs) be designed to effectively support data exploration tasks in multiple languages?",
      "What are the key challenges and solutions in integrating multilingual capabilities into existing LLM interfaces used for data exploration?",
      "To what extent does the introduction of a multilingual LLM interface improve user performance and satisfaction in analyzing and exploring datasets in diverse linguistic contexts?"
