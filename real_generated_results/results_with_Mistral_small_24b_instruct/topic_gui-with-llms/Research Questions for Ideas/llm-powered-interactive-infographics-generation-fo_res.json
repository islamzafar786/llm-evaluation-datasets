    "description": "Generating infographics often requires manual design skills and significant time investment. This process can be cumbersome, especially when dealing with large datasets that require frequent updates.",
    "motivation": "LIDA (A Tool for Automatic Generation of Grammar-Agnostic Visualizations and Infographics using Large Language Models) automates the generation of visualizations but lacks interactive capabilities for real-time adjustments. By developing an LLM-powered system that allows users to interactively generate, refine, and update infographics in real-time, we can enhance data storytelling and make it more accessible to a broader audience.",
    "questions": [
      "How can Large Language Models (LLMs) be leveraged to automate the design process of infographics for enhanced data storytelling?",
      "What are the most effective methods for integrating LLMs with existing data visualization tools to create interactive, user-friendly infographics?",
      "To what extent does the use of LLM-powered interactive infographics improve user engagement and comprehension compared to traditional static infographics in various data-intensive domains?"
