    "title": "Interactive Visualization of LLM-Generated Insights for Enhanced Data Analysis",
    "description": "Current chat-based interfaces for LLM-powered data analysis often present insights in a linear, text-heavy format that can be overwhelming and difficult to navigate. This makes it challenging for users to efficiently explore and understand complex datasets.",
    "motivation": "Existing systems like InsightLens (InsightLens: Augmenting LLM-Powered Data Analysis With Interactive Insight Management and Navigation) focus on organizing insights but lack interactive visualization capabilities that can help users quickly grasp the relationships between different data points. By integrating advanced visual analytics with LLMs, we can provide a more intuitive and efficient way for users to interact with their data.",
    "milestones": [
      "Conduct initial literature review on current LLM-based data analysis tools.",
      "Define project scope and objectives, including user requirements.",
      "Design initial interactive visualization prototypes.",
      "Develop backend infrastructure for integrating LLMs with the visualization interface.",
      "Create a frontend framework to support the interactive visualizations.",
      "Implement prototype functionality and test with sample datasets.",
      "Collect user feedback on the prototype and iterate based on findings.",
      "Refine and finalize the system, ensuring it meets all project objectives.",
      "Document the entire process, including code, design decisions, and user feedback.",
      "Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the project results."
