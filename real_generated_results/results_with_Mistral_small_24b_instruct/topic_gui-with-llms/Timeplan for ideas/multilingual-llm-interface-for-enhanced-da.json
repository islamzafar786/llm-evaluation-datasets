    "title": "Multilingual LLM Interface for Enhanced Data Exploration",
    "description": "Current LLM interfaces are often limited to a single language, which restricts their usability in multilingual environments. This limitation hinders the ability of users who speak different languages to effectively explore and analyze data.",
    "motivation": "The Applied Hedge Algebra Approach with Multilingual Large Language Models (Applied Hedge Algebra Approach with Multilingual Large Language Models to Extract Hidden Rules in Datasets for Improvement of Generative AI Applications) demonstrates the potential of multilingual LLMs but focuses on rule extraction rather than data exploration. By developing a multilingual LLM interface that supports natural language queries and visualizations in multiple languages, we can make data exploration more accessible to a global audience.",
    "milestones": [
      "Conduct initial research on existing LLM interfaces.",
      "Define project scope and objectives.",
      "Identify target languages for multilingual support.",
      "Design the architecture for a multilingual interface.",
      "Develop prototype of the multilingual LLM interface.",
      "Test the prototype with native speakers to gather feedback.",
      "Iterate on the design based on user feedback.",
      "Finalize the design and develop a beta version.",
      "Conduct comprehensive testing of the beta version.",
      "Implement any necessary changes based on test results.",
      "Prepare documentation for users and developers.",
      "Launch the final version of the multilingual LLM interface."
