    "title": "LLM-Based Interactive Data Exploration for Non-Expert Users",
    "description": "Non-expert users often find it challenging to explore and analyze complex datasets due to a lack of technical skills. This thesis aims to develop an LLM-based interactive system that guides non-expert users through the data exploration process, providing insights and recommendations based on their queries.",
    "motivation": "Current tools for data exploration are often too complex for non-experts, limiting their ability to derive meaningful insights from data. An LLM-based system can democratize data analysis by making it accessible to a broader audience.",
    "milestones": [
      "Conduct a thorough literature review on existing data exploration tools, LLM applications, and user interaction design.",
      "Define the system requirements and user needs by interviewing non-expert users and experts in data analysis.",
      "Design the architecture of the LLM-based interactive data exploration system.",
      "Develop initial prototypes for key components of the system, including query parsing, data retrieval, and recommendation generation.",
      "Implement user interface (UI) design based on user feedback from prototyping phases.",
      "Integrate LLM models into the system to handle natural language queries effectively.",
      "Conduct usability testing with non-expert users to gather feedback on the system’s effectiveness and ease of use.",
      "Refine the system based on user feedback, incorporating necessary improvements and enhancements.",
      "Prepare documentation for users, including guides and tutorials.",
      "Compile comprehensive project report detailing design choices, implementation details, and evaluation results."
