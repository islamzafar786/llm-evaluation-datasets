    "title": "LLM-Powered Interactive Data Storytelling Framework",
    "description": "Creating compelling data stories often requires significant effort in curating data, designing visuals, and crafting narratives. This thesis aims to develop an LLM-powered framework that automates the process of generating interactive data stories, making it easier for users to communicate insights effectively.",
    "motivation": "Current methods for data storytelling are labor-intensive and require specialized skills. An LLM-powered framework can streamline this process, enabling users to create engaging and informative data stories with minimal effort.",
    "milestones": [
      "Conduct a thorough literature review on existing data storytelling tools, frameworks, and LLM applications.",
      "Define the scope and requirements for the LLM-powered interactive data storytelling framework.",
      "Design the architecture for the data storytelling framework, including data processing, visualization, and narrative generation modules.",
      "Develop individual components of the framework: data curation module, visualization engine, narrative generator (using LLMs).",
      "Integrate all components into a cohesive system.",
      "Conduct initial testing and debugging to ensure functionality.",
      "Gather feedback from potential users or stakeholders for iterative improvements.",
      "Refine the framework based on user feedback and conduct further testing.",
      "Document the entire development process, including code documentation, user manuals, and academic papers.",
      "Prepare presentations and materials for project defense."
