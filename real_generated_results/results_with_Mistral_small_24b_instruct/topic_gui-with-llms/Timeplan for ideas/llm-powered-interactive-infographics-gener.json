    "description": "Generating infographics often requires manual design skills and significant time investment. This process can be cumbersome, especially when dealing with large datasets that require frequent updates.",
    "motivation": "LIDA (A Tool for Automatic Generation of Grammar-Agnostic Visualizations and Infographics using Large Language Models) automates the generation of visualizations but lacks interactive capabilities for real-time adjustments. By developing an LLM-powered system that allows users to interactively generate, refine, and update infographics in real-time, we can enhance data storytelling and make it more accessible to a broader audience.",
    "milestones": [
      "Conduct a thorough literature review on existing tools and technologies for infographic generation.",
      "Define project scope, objectives, and deliverables.",
      "Design the architecture and components of the LLM-powered system.",
      "Develop initial prototypes for key features (e.g., text-to-image conversion).",
      "Integrate machine learning models for automated design suggestions.",
      "Create a user interface prototype for interactive infographics generation.",
      "Conduct usability testing with potential users to gather feedback.",
      "Implement user feedback and refine the system.",
      "Develop documentation and training materials.",
      "Prepare for project presentation and final report."
