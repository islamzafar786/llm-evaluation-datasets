    "title": "LLM-Driven Visual Analytics Framework for Non-Expert Users",
    "description": "Visual analytics often requires specialized skills in programming, data processing, and visualization tools. This expertise barrier limits the accessibility of visual analytics to non-expert users who could benefit from these tools.",
    "motivation": "LightVA (Lightweight Visual Analytics With LLM Agent-Based Task Planning and Execution) introduces an agent-based approach but still requires some level of user expertise in task planning. By developing a more intuitive, user-friendly interface that leverages LLMs to automate the entire process from data input to visualization generation, we can democratize visual analytics for non-expert users.",
    "milestones": [
      "Conduct a literature review on existing visual analytics tools and LLM (Large Language Model) applications.",
      "Define project scope, objectives, and requirements for the framework.",
      "Design the system architecture incorporating LLMs for user interaction.",
      "Develop the initial prototype of the framework using selected technologies.",
      "Test the prototype with non-expert users to gather feedback.",
      "Iteratively refine the framework based on user feedback.",
      "Integrate advanced features and functionalities into the framework.",
      "Conduct comprehensive testing and validation.",
      "Document all processes, code, and user manuals.",
      "Prepare for project presentation and final report."
