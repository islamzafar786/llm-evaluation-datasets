    "title": "LLM-Driven Visualization Recommendation System",
    "description": "Choosing the right type of visualization for a given dataset and analytical goal is a non-trivial task. This thesis proposes an LLM-driven system that recommends appropriate visualizations based on user queries and data characteristics, enhancing the effectiveness of data analysis.",
    "motivation": "Selecting the wrong visualization can lead to misinterpretation of data and incorrect insights. An LLM-driven recommendation system can help users choose the most effective visualizations, improving the accuracy and reliability of their analyses.",
    "milestones": [
      "Define project scope and objectives.",
