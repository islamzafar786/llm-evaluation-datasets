    "title": "LLM-Augmented User Interface for Real-Time Data Visualization",
    "description": "Current data visualization tools often require users to manually adjust parameters and settings, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. This thesis aims to develop an LLM-augmented user interface that can dynamically adapt visualizations in real-time based on user queries and interactions.",
    "motivation": "Existing visualization tools lack the ability to automatically adjust to changing data and user needs without manual intervention. By leveraging LLMs, this approach can enhance efficiency and accuracy, making it easier for users to gain insights from complex datasets.",
    "milestones": [
      "Conduct a thorough literature review on existing data visualization tools, LLM integration techniques, and real-time user interfaces.",
      "Define the scope and requirements for the LLM-augmented UI based on identified gaps in current solutions.",
      "Design the architecture of the system including UI/UX design principles and backend infrastructure.",
      "Develop initial prototypes or wireframes to visualize the proposed UI enhancements.",
      "Implement core functionalities such as real-time data processing, user interaction handling, and basic visualization.",
      "Integrate LLM capabilities for dynamic adaptation based on user queries and interactions.",
      "Conduct usability testing with a small group of users to gather feedback.",
      "Refine the system based on usability test results and iterative development cycles.",
      "Prepare a comprehensive report detailing the project's findings, methods, and outcomes."
