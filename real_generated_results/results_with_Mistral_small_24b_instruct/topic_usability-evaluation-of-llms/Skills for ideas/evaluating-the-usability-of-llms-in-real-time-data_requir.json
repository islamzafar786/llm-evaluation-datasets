    "title": "Evaluating the Usability of LLMs in Real-Time Data Visualization",
    "description": "LLMs are increasingly being used to generate natural language descriptions and insights from data visualizations. However, current evaluations do not adequately address the real-time performance and usability of these models when dealing with dynamic datasets that change frequently.",
    "motivation": "Real-time data visualization is essential in fields like finance, healthcare, and emergency management, where timely decision-making is critical. Existing methods for evaluating LLMs in this context are limited to static datasets, failing to capture the challenges posed by real-time data updates. This research aims to fill this gap by developing a framework that evaluates LLM usability in dynamic, real-time scenarios.",
