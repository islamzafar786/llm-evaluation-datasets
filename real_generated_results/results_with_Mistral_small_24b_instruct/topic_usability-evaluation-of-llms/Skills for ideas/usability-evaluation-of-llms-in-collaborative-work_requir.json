    "title": "Usability Evaluation of LLMs in Collaborative Work Environments",
    "description": "Current usability evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on individual user interactions, neglecting the collaborative aspects where multiple users interact with the LLM simultaneously. This oversight limits our understanding of how LLMs perform in team settings, which are common in professional environments.",
    "motivation": "Collaborative work is a cornerstone of many industries, and effective communication within teams is crucial for productivity and innovation. Existing evaluations do not account for the complexities introduced by multiple users interacting with an LLM concurrently, such as conflicting prompts, overlapping queries, and the need for synchronized responses. This gap in research hinders the development of LLMs that can effectively support collaborative tasks.",
