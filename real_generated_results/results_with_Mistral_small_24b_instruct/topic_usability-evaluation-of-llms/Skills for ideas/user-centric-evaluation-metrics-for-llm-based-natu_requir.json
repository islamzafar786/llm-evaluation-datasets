    "title": "User-Centric Evaluation Metrics for LLM-Based Natural Language Interfaces",
    "description": "Existing evaluation metrics for LLMs often rely on automated benchmarks that do not fully capture user experiences. This research proposes new, user-centric metrics to assess the usability and effectiveness of LLM-based natural language interfaces (NLIs).",
    "motivation": "Automated evaluations may miss critical aspects of user satisfaction and task performance. Developing user-centric metrics can provide a more holistic view of LLM usability, ensuring that these models meet real-world needs. This idea is grounded in the limitations highlighted by 'LLM Comparator: Interactive Analysis of Side-by-Side Evaluation of Large Language Models' which emphasizes the need for scalable and interpretable evaluation methods.",
