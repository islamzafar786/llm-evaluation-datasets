    "title": "Evaluating the Usability of LLMs in Multilingual Contexts",
    "description": "Current usability evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on English-speaking users, neglecting the diverse linguistic needs and cultural nuances of non-English speakers. This research aims to develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating the usability of LLMs across multiple languages.",
    "motivation": "The global reach of AI applications necessitates that LLMs be usable by speakers of various languages. Existing evaluations often overlook the unique challenges faced by non-English users, such as language-specific idioms and cultural references. This gap can lead to suboptimal user experiences and reduced effectiveness in multilingual contexts.",
    "questions": [
      "How do cultural and linguistic nuances impact the perceived usability of LLMs among non-English speakers?",
      "What are the key usability challenges faced by users in different languages when interacting with Large Language Models, and how can these be addressed through design modifications?",
      "Can a standardized framework for evaluating LLM usability across multiple languages be developed, and if so, what metrics should it include to ensure comprehensive assessment?"
