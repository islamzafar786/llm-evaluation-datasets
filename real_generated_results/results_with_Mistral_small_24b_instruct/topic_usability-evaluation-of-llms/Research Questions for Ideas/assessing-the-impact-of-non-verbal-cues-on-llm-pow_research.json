    "title": "Assessing the Impact of Non-Verbal Cues on LLM-Powered Human-Robot Interaction",
    "description": "While LLMs enhance conversational capabilities in human-robot interactions, the role of non-verbal cues remains under-explored. This study investigates how non-verbal cues influence user satisfaction and task completion rates when interacting with LLM-powered robots.",
    "motivation": "Non-verbal cues are crucial for effective communication but are often overlooked in usability evaluations of LLMs. Understanding their impact can lead to more natural and intuitive interactions, enhancing the overall user experience. This research is inspired by findings from 'Understanding Large-Language Model (LLM)-powered Human-Robot Interaction' which highlights the importance of non-verbal cues.",
    "questions": [
      "How do different types of non-verbal cues (e.g., facial expressions, gestures) affect user satisfaction in human-robot interactions facilitated by LLM-powered robots?",
      "In what ways does the integration of non-verbal cues into LLM-powered robot interactions influence task completion rates compared to verbal communication alone?",
      "What specific non-verbal cues are most effective in enhancing the overall user experience when interacting with LLM-powered robots, and how do these cues impact the perceived empathy and trustworthiness of the robots?"
