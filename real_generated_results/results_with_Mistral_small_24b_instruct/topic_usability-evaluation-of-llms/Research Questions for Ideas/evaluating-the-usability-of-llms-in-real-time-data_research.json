    "title": "Evaluating the Usability of LLMs in Real-Time Data Visualization",
    "description": "LLMs are increasingly being used to generate natural language descriptions and insights from data visualizations. However, current evaluations do not adequately address the real-time performance and usability of these models when dealing with dynamic datasets that change frequently.",
    "motivation": "Real-time data visualization is essential in fields like finance, healthcare, and emergency management, where timely decision-making is critical. Existing methods for evaluating LLMs in this context are limited to static datasets, failing to capture the challenges posed by real-time data updates. This research aims to fill this gap by developing a framework that evaluates LLM usability in dynamic, real-time scenarios.",
    "questions": [
      "How does the real-time performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) compare to traditional methods in generating accurate and timely insights from dynamic datasets?",
      "What are the usability challenges faced by end-users when interacting with LLMs for real-time data visualization, and how can these challenges be mitigated through interface design improvements?",
      "To what extent does the integration of LLMs enhance the interpretability of complex, frequently changing data visualizations compared to traditional static approaches?"
