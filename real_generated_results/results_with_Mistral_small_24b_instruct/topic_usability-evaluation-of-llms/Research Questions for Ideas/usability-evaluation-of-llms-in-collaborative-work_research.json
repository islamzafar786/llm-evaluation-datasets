    "title": "Usability Evaluation of LLMs in Collaborative Work Environments",
    "description": "Current usability evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on individual user interactions, neglecting the collaborative aspects where multiple users interact with the LLM simultaneously. This oversight limits our understanding of how LLMs perform in team settings, which are common in professional environments.",
    "motivation": "Collaborative work is a cornerstone of many industries, and effective communication within teams is crucial for productivity and innovation. Existing evaluations do not account for the complexities introduced by multiple users interacting with an LLM concurrently, such as conflicting prompts, overlapping queries, and the need for synchronized responses. This gap in research hinders the development of LLMs that can effectively support collaborative tasks.",
    "questions": [
      "How does the usability of LLMs differ when used by multiple users in collaborative work environments compared to individual use?",
      "What are the specific challenges and benefits encountered by team members while interacting with an LLM simultaneously, and how do these affect overall task completion and group dynamics?",
      "Can usability evaluation metrics be adapted to better capture the collaborative dimensions of LLM interactions, and if so, what new metrics or frameworks would be most effective?"
