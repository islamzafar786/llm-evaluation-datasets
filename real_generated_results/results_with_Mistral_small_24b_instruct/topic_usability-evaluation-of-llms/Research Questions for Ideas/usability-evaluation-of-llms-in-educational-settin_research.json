    "title": "Usability Evaluation of LLMs in Educational Settings",
    "description": "LLMs have the potential to revolutionize education by providing personalized learning experiences and instant feedback. However, current evaluations do not adequately address the specific challenges and requirements of educational settings, such as the need for accurate and age-appropriate responses.",
    "motivation": "Education is a critical domain where technology can significantly enhance learning outcomes. Existing usability evaluations of LLMs in education are limited to general-purpose models, failing to capture the unique needs of students and educators. This research aims to develop an evaluation framework tailored to educational settings, focusing on accuracy, appropriateness, and effectiveness of LLM responses.",
    "questions": [
      "How do Large Language Models (LLMs) perform in generating accurate and age-appropriate responses in educational settings compared to traditional teaching methods?",
      "What are the specific usability challenges faced by educators when integrating LLMs into their instructional practices, and how can these challenges be addressed?",
      "To what extent does the use of LLMs enhance personalized learning experiences for students, and how do student outcomes compare between LLM-assisted and non-LLM-assisted educational environments?"
