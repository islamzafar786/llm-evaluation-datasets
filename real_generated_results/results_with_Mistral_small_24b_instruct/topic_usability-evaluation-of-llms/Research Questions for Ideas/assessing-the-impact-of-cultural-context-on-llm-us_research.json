    "title": "Assessing the Impact of Cultural Context on LLM Usability",
    "description": "LLMs are often trained on datasets that may not fully represent the cultural nuances and linguistic variations across different regions. This can lead to misunderstandings and reduced usability when these models are deployed in culturally diverse environments.",
    "motivation": "Cultural context plays a significant role in how users interact with technology, influencing their expectations and interpretations of responses. Current evaluations do not account for these cultural differences, leading to potential miscommunications and reduced effectiveness of LLMs in global settings. This research seeks to develop a framework that evaluates LLM usability across different cultural contexts.",
    "questions": [
      "How do cultural nuances in language influence the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) when deployed in regions with distinct linguistic and cultural backgrounds?",
      "What specific challenges do LLMs face in terms of usability when applied to culturally diverse environments, and how can these challenges be quantitatively measured?",
      "To what extent can the incorporation of culturally representative datasets during the training phase of LLMs improve their usability and effectiveness in different cultural contexts?"
