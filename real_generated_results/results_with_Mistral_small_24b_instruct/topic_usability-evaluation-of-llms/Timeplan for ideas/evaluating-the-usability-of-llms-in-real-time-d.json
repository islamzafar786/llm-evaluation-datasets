    "title": "Evaluating the Usability of LLMs in Real-Time Data Visualization",
    "description": "LLMs are increasingly being used to generate natural language descriptions and insights from data visualizations. However, current evaluations do not adequately address the real-time performance and usability of these models when dealing with dynamic datasets that change frequently.",
    "motivation": "Real-time data visualization is essential in fields like finance, healthcare, and emergency management, where timely decision-making is critical. Existing methods for evaluating LLMs in this context are limited to static datasets, failing to capture the challenges posed by real-time data updates. This research aims to fill this gap by developing a framework that evaluates LLM usability in dynamic, real-time scenarios.",
    "milestones": [
      "Define project scope and objectives.",
      "Conduct literature review on LLMs, data visualization, and usability studies.",
      "Design the evaluation framework for real-time performance and usability.",
      "Select datasets for real-time evaluation.",
      "Develop metrics to measure real-time performance and usability.",
      "Implement prototypes of LLM-based systems for data visualization.",
      "Conduct pilot testing with small user groups to gather initial feedback.",
      "Refine the system based on feedback from pilot tests.",
      "Prepare comprehensive usability test plan.",
