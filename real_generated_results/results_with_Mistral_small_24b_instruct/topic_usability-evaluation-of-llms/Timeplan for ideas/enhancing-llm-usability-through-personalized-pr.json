    "title": "Enhancing LLM Usability through Personalized Prompt Engineering",
    "description": "Users often struggle with crafting effective prompts when interacting with LLMs, leading to suboptimal outcomes. This study explores personalized prompt engineering techniques to improve user engagement and task completion rates.",
    "motivation": "Effective prompt engineering is crucial for maximizing the potential of LLMs but remains a significant barrier for many users. Personalized approaches can reduce cognitive load and enhance user satisfaction, making LLM interactions more intuitive and effective. This research builds on insights from 'Task Supportive and Personalized Human-Large Language Model Interaction: A User Study'.",
    "milestones": [
      "Conduct a comprehensive literature review on existing prompt engineering techniques.",
      "Design survey questions and conduct user interviews to understand current challenges with LLM prompts.",
      "Analyze collected data to identify common user struggles and pain points.",
      "Develop hypotheses for personalized prompt engineering techniques based on the analysis.",
      "Create an initial framework for a personalized prompt engineering system.",
      "Implement and test the framework using prototypical LLMs.",
      "Iterate on the framework based on testing feedback.",
      "Conduct user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the enhanced prompt engineering techniques.",
      "Analyze results from user studies and refine the framework accordingly.",
      "Document findings, write up the research report, and prepare for publication."
