    "title": "Assessing the Impact of Cultural Context on LLM Usability",
    "description": "LLMs are often trained on datasets that may not fully represent the cultural nuances and linguistic variations across different regions. This can lead to misunderstandings and reduced usability when these models are deployed in culturally diverse environments.",
    "motivation": "Cultural context plays a significant role in how users interact with technology, influencing their expectations and interpretations of responses. Current evaluations do not account for these cultural differences, leading to potential miscommunications and reduced effectiveness of LLMs in global settings. This research seeks to develop a framework that evaluates LLM usability across different cultural contexts.",
    "milestones": [
      "Define project scope and objectives.",
      "Conduct literature review on LLMs, cultural context, and usability.",
      "Design research methodology including data collection techniques.",
      "Develop survey instruments and pilot them for validation.",
      "Collect and analyze qualitative and quantitative data.",
      "Identify key cultural differences affecting LLM usability.",
      "Formulate recommendations to improve LLM performance in diverse contexts.",
      "Compile findings into a comprehensive report.",
      "Prepare presentation materials and finalize deliverables."
