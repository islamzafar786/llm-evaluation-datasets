    "title": "Evaluating the Usability of LLMs in High-Stakes Decision-Making Scenarios",
    "description": "LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes decision-making contexts, such as healthcare and finance. This research evaluates the usability and reliability of LLMs in these critical scenarios, focusing on user trust and decision accuracy.",
    "motivation": "High-stakes decisions require robust and reliable AI systems. Current evaluations often overlook the specific challenges and risks associated with high-stakes contexts. Understanding how LLMs perform in these scenarios can enhance their usability and ensure better outcomes for users.",
    "milestones": [
      "Define research scope, objectives, and methodology.",
      "Conduct a literature review on LLMs in high-stakes decision-making.",
      "Design user trust and decision accuracy evaluation frameworks.",
      "Recruit participants from relevant fields (healthcare, finance).",
      "Develop survey instruments and usability testing protocols.",
      "Collect baseline data on current practices without LLM use.",
      "Administer surveys and conduct usability tests involving LLMs.",
      "Analyze collected data to evaluate user trust and decision accuracy.",
      "Compare findings with baseline data and existing literature.",
      "Draft the research report detailing findings, recommendations, and future work."
