    "title": "Evaluating the Usability of LLMs in Multilingual Contexts",
    "description": "Current usability evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on English-speaking users, neglecting the diverse linguistic needs and cultural nuances of non-English speakers. This research aims to develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating the usability of LLMs across multiple languages.",
    "motivation": "The global reach of AI applications necessitates that LLMs be usable by speakers of various languages. Existing evaluations often overlook the unique challenges faced by non-English users, such as language-specific idioms and cultural references. This gap can lead to suboptimal user experiences and reduced effectiveness in multilingual contexts.",
    "milestones": [
      "Conduct literature review on usability evaluations of LLMs.",
      "Define research methodology and framework for multilingual usability evaluation.",
      "Select target languages for the study.",
      "Develop multilingual questionnaires and usability tests.",
      "Recruit participants from diverse linguistic backgrounds.",
      "Administer usability tests to participants.",
      "Analyze collected data from usability tests.",
      "Draft initial findings and identify key themes.",
      "Peer review of draft findings.",
      "Revise the framework based on feedback and additional analysis.",
      "Prepare final report and recommendations for improved multilingual LLM usability."
