  "Evaluating the Usability of LLMs in Multilingual Contexts": {
    "Problem Description": "Current usability evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on English-speaking users, neglecting the diverse linguistic needs and cultural nuances of non-English speakers. This research aims to develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating the usability of LLMs across multiple languages.",
