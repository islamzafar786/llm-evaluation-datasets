    "title": "User-Centric Evaluation Metrics for LLM-Based Natural Language Interfaces",
    "description": "Existing evaluation metrics for LLMs often rely on automated benchmarks that do not fully capture user experiences. This research proposes new, user-centric metrics to assess the usability and effectiveness of LLM-based natural language interfaces (NLIs).",
    "motivation": "Automated evaluations may miss critical aspects of user satisfaction and task performance. Developing user-centric metrics can provide a more holistic view of LLM usability, ensuring that these models meet real-world needs. This idea is grounded in the limitations highlighted by 'LLM Comparator: Interactive Analysis of Side-by-Side Evaluation of Large Language Models' which emphasizes the need for scalable and interpretable evaluation methods.",

    "title": "Enhancing LLM Usability through Personalized Prompt Engineering",
    "description": "Users often struggle with crafting effective prompts when interacting with LLMs, leading to suboptimal outcomes. This study explores personalized prompt engineering techniques to improve user engagement and task completion rates.",
    "motivation": "Effective prompt engineering is crucial for maximizing the potential of LLMs but remains a significant barrier for many users. Personalized approaches can reduce cognitive load and enhance user satisfaction, making LLM interactions more intuitive and effective. This research builds on insights from 'Task Supportive and Personalized Human-Large Language Model Interaction: A User Study'.",

    "title": "Usability Evaluation of LLMs in Collaborative Work Environments",
    "description": "Current usability evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on individual user interactions, neglecting the collaborative aspects where multiple users interact with the LLM simultaneously. This oversight limits our understanding of how LLMs perform in team settings, which are common in professional environments.",
    "motivation": "Collaborative work is a cornerstone of many industries, and effective communication within teams is crucial for productivity and innovation. Existing evaluations do not account for the complexities introduced by multiple users interacting with an LLM concurrently, such as conflicting prompts, overlapping queries, and the need for synchronized responses. This gap in research hinders the development of LLMs that can effectively support collaborative tasks.",

    "description": "LLMs are increasingly being used to generate natural language descriptions and insights from data visualizations. However, current evaluations do not adequately address the real-time performance and usability of these models when dealing with dynamic datasets that change frequently.",
    "motivation": "Real-time data visualization is essential in fields like finance, healthcare, and emergency management, where timely decision-making is critical. Existing methods for evaluating LLMs in this context are limited to static datasets, failing to capture the challenges posed by real-time data updates. This research aims to fill this gap by developing a framework that evaluates LLM usability in dynamic, real-time scenarios.",
