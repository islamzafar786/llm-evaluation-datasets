    "title": "Evaluating the Usability of LLMs in Cultural Heritage Preservation",
    "description": "This research investigates the usability of LLMs in preserving cultural heritage, focusing on their ability to generate accurate translations, contextual interpretations, and digital reconstructions of historical texts and artifacts.",
    "motivation": "Cultural heritage preservation requires a deep understanding of historical context and linguistic nuances, which LLMs currently lack. This study aims to develop a framework to assess and enhance the capabilities of LLMs in this domain.",
    "milestones": [
      "Define research objectives and questions.",
      "Conduct a literature review on LLMs and cultural heritage preservation.",
      "Identify and engage with stakeholders and cultural institutions.",
      "Select a diverse set of historical texts and artifacts for analysis.",
      "Design the methodology for evaluating LLMs.",
      "Develop a framework for assessing usability, accuracy, and interpretive capability of LLMs.",
      "Set up necessary software and tools for testing LLMs.",
      "Conduct preliminary tests to calibrate LLMs' performance.",
      "Analyze initial data and refine testing methodologies.",
      "Execute main testing phase with selected historical texts and artifacts.",
      "Collect and organize data from testing phase.",
      "Perform in-depth analysis of LLM output, focusing on translation accuracy and contextual interpretation.",
      "Evaluate LLMs' ability to digitally reconstruct artifacts.",
      "Gather feedback from cultural experts and stakeholders on LLM outputs.",
      "Synthesize findings into a comprehensive report.",
      "Draft research paper outlining methodology, findings, and implications.",
      "Submit research paper to relevant journals or conferences.",
      "Prepare a presentation for stakeholders to demonstrate findings.",
      "Develop recommendations for further research or implementation.",
      "Compile all project documentation and deliverables.",
      "Conduct a final project review and reflection."
