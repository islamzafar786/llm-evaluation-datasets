    "description": "Develop an interactive framework for evaluating the usability of LLMs in cybersecurity, focusing on their ability to engage with and respond to cyber threats.",
    "motivation": "LLMs have potential in cybersecurity, but their interactive usability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios are not well understood. A focused evaluation can enhance their application in this critical field.",
    "milestones": [
      "Conduct a comprehensive literature review on LLMs and cybersecurity.",
      "Identify key usability metrics relevant to LLMs in cybersecurity contexts.",
      "Design a preliminary framework for usability evaluation.",
      "Recruit cybersecurity professionals for initial interviews and feedback sessions.",
      "Develop interactive testing scenarios that simulate cyber threats for LLM evaluation.",
      "Implement the first version of the framework in a controlled environment.",
      "Conduct initial usability tests with selected LLMs.",
      "Analyze initial results and refine the framework based on feedback.",
      "Prepare a mid-project progress report highlighting initial findings and adjustments.",
      "Recruit additional participants for expanded testing.",
      "Conduct a second round of usability testing with a broader range of LLMs.",
      "Compile and analyze data from the second round of testing.",
      "Refine framework further and prepare a final version for comprehensive evaluation.",
      "Conduct final usability tests with the refined framework.",
      "Analyze final testing results and draw conclusions on LLM usability in cybersecurity.",
      "Prepare a comprehensive final report summarizing research findings.",
      "Develop visual aids and presentations for stakeholders.",
      "Organize a project presentation to discuss findings and implications with stakeholders.",
      "Prepare for publication in relevant academic and industry journals."
