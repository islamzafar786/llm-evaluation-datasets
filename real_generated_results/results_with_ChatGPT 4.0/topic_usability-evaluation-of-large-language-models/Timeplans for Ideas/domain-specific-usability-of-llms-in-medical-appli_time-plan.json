      "Design a methodology for usability assessment.",
      "Acquire necessary datasets for evaluation.",
      "Prepare and preprocess datasets for LLM evaluation.",
      "Select appropriate LLM models for assessment.",
      "Develop a framework for evaluating LLM usability.",
      "Conduct initial LLM evaluations on preselected tasks.",
      "Analyze initial results to identify trends and issues.",
      "Iterate on the evaluation methodology as needed.",
      "Expand evaluation to additional medical domains.",
      "Conduct comprehensive usability testing across domains.",
      "Analyze results for accuracy and explainability.",
      "Compile findings into a comprehensive report.",
      "Draft a paper for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.",
      "Prepare a presentation for stakeholders.",
      "Conduct a peer review of the draft paper.",
