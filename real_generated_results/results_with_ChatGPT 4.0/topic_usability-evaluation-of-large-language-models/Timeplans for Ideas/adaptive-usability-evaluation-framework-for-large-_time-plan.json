    "title": "Adaptive Usability Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models",
    "description": "Develop an adaptive framework for evaluating the usability of LLMs across various domains, focusing on user interaction and satisfaction metrics.",
    "motivation": "Current evaluation methods often overlook user-centric metrics, focusing instead on technical performance. An adaptive framework can provide insights into how users interact with LLMs, enhancing their usability and acceptance.",
    "milestones": [
      "Conduct a comprehensive literature review on LLM usability and evaluation metrics.",
      "Identify and categorize domains for LLM usability evaluation.",
      "Develop a preliminary framework for usability evaluation.",
      "Design a methodology for user interaction and satisfaction data collection.",
      "Recruit domain experts and users for initial testing.",
      "Pilot test the framework with a small user group.",
      "Analyze pilot test results and refine the framework.",
      "Develop a comprehensive plan for large-scale testing across selected domains.",
      "Implement the large-scale usability evaluation.",
      "Collect and analyze data from large-scale testing.",
      "Iterate and refine the framework based on findings.",
      "Document the final framework and prepare a detailed report.",
      "Develop recommendations for stakeholders based on findings."
