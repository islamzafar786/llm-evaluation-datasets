    "description": "Examine the usability of LLMs in software development tasks, focusing on human-LLM interaction and task efficiency.",
    "motivation": "While LLMs are increasingly used in software development, their impact on human efficiency and task completion remains unclear. A human-centric evaluation can provide insights into optimizing these interactions.",
    "questions": [
      "How do software developers perceive the usability and effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) when integrated into their everyday coding tasks?",
      "What impact do LLMs have on the efficiency and quality of software development, as measured by task completion time and error rate, compared to traditional development practices?",
      "How does the interaction between software developers and LLMs evolve over time, and what factors influence the successful adoption and integration of these technologies in the development process?"
