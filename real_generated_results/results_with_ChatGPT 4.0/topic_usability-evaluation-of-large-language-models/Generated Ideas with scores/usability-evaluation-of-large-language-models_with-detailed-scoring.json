  "Evaluating the Usability of LLMs in Creative Writing Assistance": {
    "Problem Description": "This research aims to evaluate the usability of large language models (LLMs) in assisting creative writing tasks, focusing on their ability to generate coherent narratives, character development, and thematic consistency.",
    "Problem Motivation": "While LLMs have shown potential in generating text, their application in creative writing remains underexplored.

The idea is theoretically consistent with the current understanding of LLMs and their capabilities. However, empirical support is somewhat limited due to the novelty of the application in creative writing.
