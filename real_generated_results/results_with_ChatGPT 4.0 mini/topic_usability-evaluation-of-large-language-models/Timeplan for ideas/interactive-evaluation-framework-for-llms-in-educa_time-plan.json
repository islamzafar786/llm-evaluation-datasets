    "title": "Interactive Evaluation Framework for LLMs in Educational Settings",
    "description": "While LLMs have shown promise in educational applications, their evaluation often lacks a dynamic, interactive component that reflects real-time user engagement and learning outcomes. This thesis proposes an interactive evaluation framework that assesses LLMs based on student interactions, learning progress, and feedback mechanisms.",
    "motivation": "The educational landscape is rapidly evolving with AI integration, yet the evaluation of LLMs remains static and does not account for the interactive nature of learning. By developing a framework that captures user engagement and adaptability, this research aims to provide insights into how LLMs can be optimized for educational purposes, addressing the gap between theoretical performance and practical usability.",
    "milestones": [
      "Conduct a literature review on existing LLM evaluation frameworks (Weeks 1-2)",
      "Define the objectives and scope of the interactive evaluation framework (Week 3)",
      "Identify key metrics for assessing student interactions and learning outcomes (Weeks 4-5)",
      "Design the interactive evaluation framework architecture (Weeks 6-7)",
      "Develop a prototype of the evaluation framework (Weeks 8-12)",
      "Conduct pilot testing of the prototype with a small group of users (Weeks 13-15)",
      "Collect feedback from pilot testing and refine the framework (Weeks 16-18)",
      "Document the framework's design, methodology, and findings (Weeks 19-21)",
      "Prepare the final report and presentation of the interactive evaluation framework (Weeks 22-24)"
