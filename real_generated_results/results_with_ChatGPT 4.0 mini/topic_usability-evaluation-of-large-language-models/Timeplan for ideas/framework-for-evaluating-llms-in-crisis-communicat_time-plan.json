    "title": "Framework for Evaluating LLMs in Crisis Communication Scenarios",
    "description": "This research will develop a framework to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in crisis communication, focusing on their ability to provide timely, accurate, and empathetic responses during emergencies. Current evaluation methods do not adequately address the unique challenges posed by crisis situations.",
    "motivation": "In times of crisis, effective communication is critical for public safety and trust. LLMs have the potential to assist in disseminating information quickly, but their current limitations in understanding context and urgency can lead to misinformation. This study aims to create a framework that ensures LLMs can be reliably used in crisis communication, thereby enhancing public safety.",
    "milestones": [
      "Conduct literature review on LLMs and crisis communication (Weeks 1-3)",
      "Identify key evaluation criteria for LLMs in crisis contexts (Weeks 4-5)",
      "Develop a framework outlining evaluation methodology (Weeks 6-8)",
      "Gather case studies of LLM usage in real crisis scenarios (Weeks 9-11)",
      "Analyze case studies to refine the evaluation framework (Weeks 12-14)",
      "Pilot test the evaluation framework on selected LLMs (Weeks 15-17)",
      "Collect feedback and iterate on the framework (Weeks 18-20)",
      "Prepare final report detailing findings and recommendations (Weeks 21-23)",
      "Present findings to stakeholders and submit for publication (Week 24)"
