    "title": "Framework for Evaluating LLMs in Generating Personalized Health Information",
    "description": "The ability of LLMs to generate personalized health information is promising, yet there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks that assess the accuracy, relevance, and personalization of the information provided. This thesis proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that incorporates user feedback and clinical validation.",
    "motivation": "Personalized health information can significantly improve patient engagement and adherence to treatment plans. However, without a robust evaluation framework, the risks of misinformation and lack of relevance remain high. This research aims to establish a systematic approach to evaluate LLMs in generating personalized health content, ensuring that patients receive accurate and tailored information.",
    "milestones": [
      "Conduct literature review on LLMs and health information generation (Weeks 1-3)",
      "Identify gaps in existing evaluation frameworks (Weeks 4-5)",
      "Develop a preliminary outline for the evaluation framework (Weeks 6-7)",
      "Design user feedback mechanisms (Weeks 8-9)",
      "Plan clinical validation processes (Weeks 10-11)",
      "Draft the evaluation framework (Weeks 12-14)",
      "Conduct initial testing of the framework with sample data (Weeks 15-16)",
      "Gather feedback from users and clinical experts (Weeks 17-18)",
      "Revise the framework based on feedback (Weeks 19-20)",
      "Prepare final report and presentation of the evaluation framework (Weeks 21-22)",
      "Submit the thesis and framework for review (Weeks 23-24)"
