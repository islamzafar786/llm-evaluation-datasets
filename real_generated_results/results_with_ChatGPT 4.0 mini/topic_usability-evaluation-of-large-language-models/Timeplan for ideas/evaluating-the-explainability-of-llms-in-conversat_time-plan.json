    "title": "Evaluating the Explainability of LLMs in Conversational Recommendation Systems",
    "description": "Existing evaluation methods for conversational recommendation systems (CRSs) using LLMs often overlook the importance of explainability in user interactions. This research aims to develop an evaluation framework that assesses the explainability of LLM-generated recommendations and its effect on user trust and satisfaction.",
    "motivation": "As LLMs are increasingly used in CRSs, users must understand the rationale behind recommendations to trust and act on them. Current evaluation protocols do not adequately measure explainability, which is critical for user acceptance and effective decision-making. This research seeks to fill this gap by providing a framework that emphasizes the importance of explainability in enhancing user experience with LLMs.",
    "milestones": [
      "Conduct a literature review on explainability in LLMs and CRSs (Weeks 1-2)",
      "Identify key metrics for evaluating explainability (Weeks 3-4)",
      "Design a preliminary evaluation framework (Weeks 5-6)",
      "Develop a prototype conversational recommendation system using LLMs (Weeks 7-10)",
      "Implement the evaluation framework in the prototype system (Weeks 11-12)",
      "Conduct user studies to assess user trust and satisfaction (Weeks 13-16)",
      "Analyze user study data (Weeks 17-18)",
      "Refine the evaluation framework based on user feedback (Weeks 19-20)",
      "Prepare a draft report outlining findings and recommendations (Weeks 21-22)",
      "Review and finalize the research report (Weeks 23-24)"
