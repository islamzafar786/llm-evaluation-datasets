    "title": "Framework for Evaluating LLMs in Generating Personalized Health Information",
    "description": "The ability of LLMs to generate personalized health information is promising, yet there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks that assess the accuracy, relevance, and personalization of the information provided. This thesis proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that incorporates user feedback and clinical validation.",
    "motivation": "Personalized health information can significantly improve patient engagement and adherence to treatment plans. However, without a robust evaluation framework, the risks of misinformation and lack of relevance remain high. This research aims to establish a systematic approach to evaluate LLMs in generating personalized health content, ensuring that patients receive accurate and tailored information.",
    "questions": [
      "What criteria should be included in a multi-dimensional evaluation framework to assess the accuracy and relevance of personalized health information generated by LLMs?",
      "How does user feedback influence the perceived personalization and trustworthiness of health information generated by LLMs in different demographic groups?",
      "What methodologies can be employed to clinically validate the health information generated by LLMs within the proposed evaluation framework?"
