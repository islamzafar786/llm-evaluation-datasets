    "title": "Framework for Evaluating LLMs in Crisis Communication Scenarios",
    "description": "This research will develop a framework to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in crisis communication, focusing on their ability to provide timely, accurate, and empathetic responses during emergencies. Current evaluation methods do not adequately address the unique challenges posed by crisis situations.",
    "motivation": "In times of crisis, effective communication is critical for public safety and trust. LLMs have the potential to assist in disseminating information quickly, but their current limitations in understanding context and urgency can lead to misinformation. This study aims to create a framework that ensures LLMs can be reliably used in crisis communication, thereby enhancing public safety.",
    "questions": [
      "What criteria should be included in a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in crisis communication scenarios?",
      "How do LLMs perform in terms of timeliness, accuracy, and empathy when providing responses during simulated crisis situations compared to traditional communication methods?",
      "What are the unique challenges posed by crisis communication that current evaluation methods for LLMs fail to address, and how can these challenges be incorporated into a new evaluation framework?"
