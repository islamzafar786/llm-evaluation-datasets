  "Using Decision Trees for Binary Classification": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea is straightforward but lacks depth and specificity. The problem definition is clear, but the methodology and expected outcomes are not well-defined. Key terms like 'decision trees' are implied to be understood without explanation. There is room for interpretation in what specific aspects of decision trees will be explored or how they will be applied.",

  "Generating Earthquake Predictions with ChatGPT": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea is somewhat understandable but lacks precision in key areas. The problem definition is clear, but the methodology and expected outcomes are not well-defined. Technical terms like 'ChatGPT' and 'general world knowledge' are used without explanation, leading to ambiguity. The structural organization is basic, with no clear distinction between components. Specificity is low as it does not provide concrete details on how ChatGPT will be utilized for earthquake prediction.",

  "Training Neural Networks to Predict Earthquakes Using social media comments": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea presents an intriguing concept but lacks specificity and clarity in several areas. The problem definition is somewhat clear, but the objectives and scope are not well-defined. Key terms like 'sentiment analysis' and 'seismic activity' are used without precise definitions or explanations of how they will be measured. The structural organization is basic, with a simple flow from problem to motivation but missing details on methodology and expected outcomes. There is significant room for interpretation regarding the feasibility and practicality of using social media comments to predict earthquakes.",

    "Rationale": "The thesis idea is straightforward but lacks depth and specificity. The problem definition is clear, but the terminology could be more precise, especially regarding 'LLMs' which are not defined. The structural organization is logical but could benefit from more detail on methods and expected outcomes. There is some ambiguity in what exactly will be done with LLMs for plant classification.",

  "Optimizing Sorting Algorithms with LLMs": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea is somewhat clear but lacks depth and specificity. The problem definition is understandable, but the motivation for using LLMs in sorting algorithms is not well-connected to the actual problem of optimizing sorting algorithms.
