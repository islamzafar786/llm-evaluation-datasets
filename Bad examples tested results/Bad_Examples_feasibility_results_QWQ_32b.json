  "Generating Earthquake Predictions with ChatGPT": {
    "Rationale": "The project faces significant challenges across all criteria. Earthquake prediction is an unsolved scientific problem, and using ChatGPT for this task lacks theoretical grounding. Reliable earthquake datasets are limited in temporal and spatial precision, requiring extensive curation. Training such a model would demand massive computational resources beyond standard access. The implementation requires both novel geophysical theory and advanced ML engineering, making it overly complex for a master's thesis timeline.",

  "Training Neural Networks to Predict Earthquakes Using social media comments": {
    "Rationale": "The feasibility is limited by the dataset availability and timeline. While computational resources are manageable, obtaining a reliable labeled earthquake-sentiment dataset would require extensive manual effort. The theoretical complexity is moderate but aligns with established methods. However, completing this within six months is challenging due to data collection and model validation phases.",

  "Using LLMs to Classify Plant Species": {
    "Rationale": "The project faces significant challenges in dataset availability and computational requirements. While theoretical complexity is manageable, the need for specialized plant image datasets and access to large-scale GPU resources may hinder progress within a standard thesis timeline.",

  "Optimizing Sorting Algorithms with LLMs": {
    "Rationale": "The project aims to use LLMs to optimize traditional sorting algorithms like QuickSort. While the motivation is interesting, there are significant challenges in dataset availability and theoretical complexity. Sorting algorithms operate on numerical data structures, whereas LLMs excel at language tasks. Adapting LLMs for this purpose may require novel methods without existing datasets. Computational resources might be manageable with standard setups, but the timeline could be tight due to uncharted territory.",
