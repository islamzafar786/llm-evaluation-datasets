  "Building a ChatGPT Clone with OpenAI API": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea \u2013 building a ChatGPT clone using the OpenAI API \u2013 is conceptually simple and aligns with current trends in chatbot development. However, it lacks depth and presents a significant challenge given the proprietary nature of the OpenAI API and the complexity of replicating ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities. While utilizing an existing API simplifies the *implementation* aspect, it doesn't address fundamental research questions about LLM architecture, training methodologies, or conversational AI design. The motivation \u2013 providing accessible chatbot development \u2013 is valid but somewhat superficial without acknowledging the limitations of simply wrapping an existing service.",

  "Using Decision Trees for Binary Classification": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea \u2013 applying decision trees for spam filtering \u2013 is a fundamentally sound starting point, aligning with established knowledge and offering a relatively straightforward approach. However, given the lack of provided related literature, a more nuanced assessment requires extrapolating from existing research on classification algorithms and spam detection.

While the motivation of reducing earthquake-related fatalities is laudable, relying on a large language model for this task presents significant theoretical and methodological challenges.

However, the proposal lacks sufficient detail and currently relies heavily on an unstated assumption about how LLMs can effectively process visual information.

The motivation \u2013 aiding botanists with taxonomic studies \u2013 is sound and relevant.
