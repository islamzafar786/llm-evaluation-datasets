  "Building a ChatGPT Clone with OpenAI API": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea of building a ChatGPT clone using the OpenAI API is theoretically consistent with established knowledge since it leverages existing large language models (LLMs), which are well-documented in literature. The motivation aligns with educational needs for accessible AI tools, supported by studies on democratizing AI access. However, there's no novel theoretical contribution here; it's an application rather than a research advancement. Empirical support is limited because the project primarily demonstrates API usage without testing new hypotheses or comparing against benchmarks. Logical coherence exists but lacks depth\u2014creating a chatbot with OpenAI API is straightforward, yet the problem statement doesn't address challenges like ethical use or customization beyond basic implementation. Methodologically, while using APIs is sound for replication, the approach lacks rigor in evaluating performance metrics or addressing limitations such as dependency on external services.",

  "Using Decision Trees for Binary Classification": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea of applying decision trees to email spam classification is theoretically consistent as decision trees are a well-established method for binary classification. The problem aligns with common applications in machine learning literature, such as using decision trees for spam detection. Logical coherence is strong since the methodology directly addresses the stated goal. Methodologically sound given decision trees' suitability for interpretable models and feature importance analysis relevant to email features like word frequency or sender patterns. Empirical support is moderate due to existing studies showing decision trees can be effective but often outperformed by ensemble methods like Random Forests or gradient boosting in spam detection contexts.",

  "Generating Earthquake Predictions with ChatGPT": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea of using ChatGPT to predict earthquakes' time and location faces significant theoretical, empirical, and methodological challenges. Theoretically, earthquake prediction remains an unsolved problem in seismology; no established theory allows precise forecasts due to the chaotic nature of tectonic processes (e.g., Geller & Jackson, 1998). ChatGPT, as a language model trained on text data, lacks access to real-time geophysical sensors or physical models required for such predictions. Empirically, existing studies show that machine learning models require specific seismic datasets (e.g., aftershock prediction via ML in Weimer et al., 2018), which ChatGPT does not utilize. Logically, the proposal conflates general knowledge with predictive capability; ChatGPT cannot infer physical processes from text alone. Methodologically, using a language model for time/location prediction is inappropriate since it lacks geospatial-temporal modeling components and validation against seismic datasets.",

  "Training Neural Networks to Predict Earthquakes Using social media comments": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea of using sentiment analysis on social media comments to predict earthquakes faces significant theoretical and empirical challenges. Seismology has established that earthquake prediction remains an unsolved problem, with no known precursors reliably indicating imminent seismic events. The proposed method assumes a causal link between human unease (measured via social media) and seismic activity, which lacks direct evidence. While sentiment analysis can capture societal anxiety, there is no established theory linking psychological states to tectonic processes. Empirically, existing studies on disaster prediction using social media focus on post-event reporting rather than premonitory signals. Methodologically, the approach may conflate correlation with causation and face challenges in temporal alignment between sentiment spikes and earthquake timing. However, the idea is logically coherent within its own framework if assuming a plausible pathway (e.g., subtle environmental changes causing unease). The lack of related literature provides no direct support but also no explicit contradictions.",

  "Using LLMs to Classify Plant Species": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea of using LLMs for plant species classification raises several considerations. Theoretical consistency is moderate because while LLMs are primarily text-based, image classification typically relies on CNNs or transformers like ViT. However, multimodal models (e.g., CLIP) bridge this gap by integrating text and visual data. Empirical support is limited as most existing work uses vision models for plant classification, though recent studies show promise with multimodal LLMs. Logical coherence is strong if the approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model fine-tuned on labeled image-text pairs. Methodological soundness depends on whether they use appropriate datasets (e.g., PlantCLEF) and evaluation metrics like accuracy or F1-score, but challenges include data scarcity and domain adaptation.",

  "Optimizing Sorting Algorithms with LLMs": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea of optimizing sorting algorithms with LLMs raises several questions. Theoretical consistency is moderate as LLMs are primarily designed for language tasks, and there's no established theory linking them to algorithm optimization. Empirical support is lacking since existing literature doesn't show LLMs improving computational efficiency in non-language domains. Logical coherence is present but weak due to unclear mechanisms of how LLMs would enhance sorting algorithms. Methodological soundness depends on proposed methods; without specifics, it's hard to assess but likely low given the novelty and lack of prior work.",
