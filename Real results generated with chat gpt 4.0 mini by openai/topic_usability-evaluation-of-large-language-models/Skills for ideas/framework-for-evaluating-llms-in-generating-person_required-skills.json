    "title": "Framework for Evaluating LLMs in Generating Personalized Health Information",
    "description": "The ability of LLMs to generate personalized health information is promising, yet there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks that assess the accuracy, relevance, and personalization of the information provided. This thesis proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that incorporates user feedback and clinical validation.",
    "motivation": "Personalized health information can significantly improve patient engagement and adherence to treatment plans. However, without a robust evaluation framework, the risks of misinformation and lack of relevance remain high. This research aims to establish a systematic approach to evaluate LLMs in generating personalized health content, ensuring that patients receive accurate and tailored information.",
