    "title": "Evaluating the Usability of LLMs in Mental Health Support Applications",
    "description": "This research aims to evaluate the usability of large language models (LLMs) in providing mental health support through chatbots. Current LLMs often generate responses that lack empathy, context-awareness, and personalization, which are critical in mental health interactions. This study will assess how well LLMs can engage users in a supportive manner and provide appropriate responses to sensitive topics.",
    "motivation": "Mental health issues are on the rise, and many individuals seek support online. However, existing LLMs may not be equipped to handle the nuances of mental health conversations, leading to potential harm. By developing a framework to evaluate LLMs specifically for mental health applications, this research can contribute to safer and more effective AI-driven support systems.",
    "questions": [
      "How do users perceive the empathy and contextual awareness of responses generated by LLMs in mental health support chatbots?",
      "What specific design features enhance the personalization of LLM-generated responses in mental health applications, and how do these features impact user satisfaction?",
      "In what ways do the limitations of LLMs affect their ability to provide appropriate support during sensitive mental health discussions, and how can these limitations be addressed?"
