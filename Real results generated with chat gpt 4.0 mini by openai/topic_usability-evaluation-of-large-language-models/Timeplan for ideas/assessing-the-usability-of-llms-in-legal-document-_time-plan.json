    "title": "Assessing the Usability of LLMs in Legal Document Analysis",
    "description": "This thesis will investigate the usability of LLMs in analyzing and summarizing legal documents. Current methods often struggle with the complexity and specificity of legal language, resulting in inaccuracies and misinterpretations. This research will focus on developing evaluation metrics tailored to the legal domain to assess LLM performance.",
    "motivation": "Legal professionals increasingly rely on AI tools for document analysis, yet the risk of misinterpretation can have serious consequences. By creating a robust evaluation framework for LLMs in this context, the study aims to enhance the reliability of AI tools in legal practice, ultimately improving efficiency and accuracy in legal work.",
    "milestones": [
      "Conduct literature review on LLMs and legal document analysis (Weeks 1-3)",
      "Identify key evaluation metrics specific to the legal domain (Weeks 4-5)",
      "Select LLMs for analysis and summarization tasks (Weeks 6-7)",
      "Gather and preprocess legal documents for testing (Weeks 8-10)",
      "Design experiments to evaluate LLMs against the identified metrics (Weeks 11-12)",
      "Conduct experiments and collect data (Weeks 13-15)",
      "Analyze results and compare LLM performance (Weeks 16-18)",
      "Draft the thesis document, including findings and discussions (Weeks 19-21)",
      "Review and revise the thesis based on feedback (Weeks 22-23)",
      "Prepare for final presentation and submission (Week 24)"
