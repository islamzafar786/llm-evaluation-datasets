  "Evaluating User-Centric Usability of LLMs in Healthcare Communication": {
    "Problem Description": "Current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare often focus on accuracy and clinical relevance, neglecting user experience and communication effectiveness. This research aims to develop a comprehensive usability evaluation framework that incorporates user feedback from healthcare professionals and patients when interacting with LLMs for medical inquiries.",
    "Problem Motivation": "As LLMs are increasingly integrated into healthcare settings, ensuring that they communicate effectively and understandably with both professionals and patients is crucial. Existing studies primarily assess LLMs based on technical metrics, which may overlook how well these models facilitate real-world communication. A user-centric approach is necessary to enhance the practical application of LLMs in healthcare, ultimately improving patient outcomes and satisfaction.",

Current LLMs often generate responses that lack empathy, context-awareness, and personalization, which are critical in mental health interactions. This study will assess how well LLMs can engage users in a supportive manner and provide appropriate responses to sensitive topics.",
    "Problem Motivation": "Mental health issues are on the rise, and many individuals seek support online. However, existing LLMs may not be equipped to handle the nuances of mental health conversations, leading to potential harm. By developing a framework to evaluate LLMs specifically for mental health applications, this research can contribute to safer and more effective AI-driven support systems.",

The methodology proposed for evaluating LLMs is coherent and aligns with established usability testing frameworks. However, empirical support may be limited as this is a relatively new area of research, and specific studies on LLMs in mental health contexts are still emerging.",
