  "Optimizing Sorting Algorithms with LLMs": {
    "Rationale": "The project involves using large language models to optimize traditional sorting algorithms, which is a novel and ambitious idea. While LLMs are powerful for natural language processing tasks, their application to algorithm optimization, particularly for well-understood problems like QuickSort, presents significant challenges in terms of dataset availability, computational resources, theoretical complexity, and timeline.",

  "Improving Artificial Intelligence": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea 'Improving Artificial Intelligence' is extremely vague and lacks specificity. It does not define what aspects of AI need improvement, the methods to be used, or the specific goals. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to assess dataset availability, computational requirements, theoretical complexity, and timeline feasibility.",
