  "Building a ChatGPT Clone with OpenAI API": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea, 'Building a ChatGPT Clone with OpenAI API,' presents a relatively low level of novelty. While the *need* for accessible chatbot development is acknowledged, simply replicating ChatGPT functionality using an existing API is not a groundbreaking research contribution. The problem itself \u2013 creating a chatbot \u2013 has been extensively studied and addressed by numerous projects and tools.  The motivation\u2014student access to intelligent chatbots\u2014is valid but doesn't justify significant novelty in the proposed approach.",

    "Rationale": "The thesis idea, 'Using Decision Trees for Binary Classification,' represents a very low level of novelty.

  "Generating Earthquake Predictions with ChatGPT": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea, 'Generating Earthquake Predictions with ChatGPT,' presents a fundamentally interesting but ultimately limited approach. While the motivation \u2013 reducing earthquake fatalities \u2013 is undeniably important, the proposed methodology relies on leveraging a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT for prediction, which represents a significant novelty in this specific context. However, it's crucial to recognize that current LLMs are not designed for time-series forecasting or geological data analysis and their application here is speculative at best. The core problem of earthquake prediction is extremely well-studied; decades of research have focused on seismic monitoring, statistical modeling, and physics-based simulations \u2013 all of which offer far more established and reliable methods than relying on a general-purpose LLM.",

  "Training Neural Networks to Predict Earthquakes Using social media comments": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea proposes a relatively common approach \u2013 leveraging social media data for disaster prediction. While the *concept* of using social media to detect precursory signals is gaining traction, specifically applying sentiment analysis to predict earthquakes presents several challenges and requires careful consideration. The core research problem\u2014linking subjective emotional expressions on social media with seismic activity\u2014is not entirely new, but the specific focus on *sentiment* as a predictive factor within this context warrants further investigation.  Existing work in earthquake early warning systems primarily focuses on geophysical data (ground motion, strain) or more structured data sources like seismograph networks. The motivation \u2013 that people express unease before earthquakes \u2013 is plausible, but needs robust validation and isn't universally observed. Furthermore, the method of simply applying sentiment analysis to comments without accounting for potential biases, misinformation, or irrelevant chatter could lead to unreliable predictions.  The novelty lies more in *how* this approach is attempted rather than a fundamentally new problem.",

  "Using LLMs to Classify Plant Species": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea \u2013 using LLMs for plant species classification \u2013 represents a moderately novel approach. The core problem of classifying plant images is well-established in botany and computer vision, with numerous existing methods like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieving high accuracy. However, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), traditionally used for text, to tackle this visual classification task introduces a new perspective. While LLMs have been explored for zero-shot or few-shot image classification recently, applying them directly to plant imagery and framing it within the context of botanical taxonomy is not yet widely established. The motivation \u2013 assisting botanists with taxonomic studies \u2013 is sound and aligns with current needs in the field.",

  "Optimizing Sorting Algorithms with LLMs": {

While the core problem of improving sorting efficiency is well-established, leveraging LLMs for this specific task represents a less explored area. Current research in algorithm optimization primarily focuses on traditional techniques like dynamic programming, heuristics, and parallelization. Introducing an LLM as a 'meta-optimizer' to suggest algorithmic modifications or parameter tuning within existing algorithms is a new direction. However, it\u2019s important to note that the application of LLMs to code generation and optimization is gaining traction, but applying them directly to *algorithm design* \u2013 specifically sorting \u2013 remains relatively unexplored at this level of detail.",

  "Developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea of 'Developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)' is fundamentally ambitious and, as such, possesses a high degree of problem novelty. However, the proposed approach \u2013 simply building a general-purpose AI agent capable of performing any human intellectual task \u2013 is not entirely novel in its aspiration. It represents a long-standing goal within AI research.  The methodology described (building an agent) is also standard; it\u2019s the *generalization* to AGI that presents the challenge, not the specific technique used for implementation. While many researchers are working on various aspects of achieving AGI, this thesis doesn't specify a particular architecture or learning paradigm, which limits its methodological innovation score. The potential impact is undeniably high \u2013 revolutionizing society as claimed \u2013 but realizing such an impact requires overcoming significant technical hurdles and raises ethical considerations that aren\u2019t addressed in the initial description.  The combination of 'AGI development' with a general agent framework is common; many projects aim to create intelligent agents, but few explicitly target AGI.

The problem of BCI control is well-studied, with numerous existing systems utilizing EEG, fMRI, and invasive electrode arrays for various applications (e.g., prosthetic limb control, assistive technology). However, focusing on *direct* communication with AI systems \u2013 implying a closed-loop system where the AI actively responds to brain signals in real-time \u2013 represents a step beyond current capabilities.
