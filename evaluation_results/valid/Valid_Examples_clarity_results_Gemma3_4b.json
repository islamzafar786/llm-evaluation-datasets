    "Rationale": "The thesis idea presents a fascinating concept but suffers from significant ambiguity and lacks sufficient detail. The 'reverse evolution' framing is intriguing, yet the core research question \u2013 training dinosaurs to use smartphones \u2013 requires substantial clarification. While the motivation (investigating dinosaur intelligence) is reasonable, it\u2019s presented somewhat abstractly. The proposed method (deep reinforcement learning) is mentioned but not explained in enough depth for a master's thesis. The scope of what 'interacting with smartphones' entails isn't defined.

The motivation is plausible, yet the proposed method \u2013 interpreting pigeon movements with AI \u2013 lacks specific technical details regarding the AI model, sensor data, or how behavioral patterns are linked to seismic activity.

    "Rationale": "The thesis idea presents a high-level concept with significant challenges in terms of feasibility and clarity. While the motivation is understandable (blockchain transaction speed), the core proposal \u2013 using quantum entanglement for instant financial transactions \u2013 requires substantial elaboration. The problem definition is somewhat clear, but lacks detail regarding *how* entanglement would be utilized within a blockchain context. Terminology precision is low due to the lack of explanation of 'quantum entanglement' and its application in this specific scenario. Structural organization is rudimentary; it\u2019s essentially a statement of intent without outlining research methods or expected outcomes. Specificity is extremely limited \u2013 it doesn't specify what aspects of quantum entanglement will be explored, nor does it address potential limitations or alternative approaches.

The problem description is reasonably clear in its overall goal \u2013 analyzing dolphin vocalizations for emotional states and potential linguistic structures. However, the application of 'Large Language Models' (LLMs) needs more context. It\u2019s unclear how LLMs will be applied specifically to this task; simply stating they will be used isn't sufficient. The motivation is sound but lacks detail regarding *why* decoding dolphin communication is important beyond a general \u2018bridging the gap.\u2019  The scope is broad, and while it mentions analyzing vocalizations, it doesn\u2019t specify which types of vocalizations or what specific linguistic features are being targeted.

The problem description is reasonably well-defined, outlining the challenges of integrating ML into existing systems. While the motivation is stated, it could be more focused. The terminology is generally understandable but relies on context rather than explicit definition (e.g., 'SAP Leonardo'). The structural organization is decent, presenting the problem, motivation, and a proposed approach.

While the motivation section highlights the potential of ML in finance, it doesn't fully articulate how the specific methodology addresses existing limitations of traditional strategies.
