  "Predicting Default Loans using Machine Learning": {
    "Rationale": "The thesis idea proposes using machine learning algorithms to predict loan defaults, which is a well-established problem in the credit industry. The motivation for this study is driven by the desire to improve risk assessment and decision-making processes. While there are no related papers provided, the literature on credit scoring and machine learning suggests that this topic has been explored before. However, the proposed approach of comparing multiple algorithms on a standardized dataset could provide valuable insights into their performance.",
