  "Using Machine Learning Methods for Evaluating the Quality of Technical Documents": {
    "Rationale": "The problem is clearly stated with a focus on evaluating technical document quality using machine learning, especially distinguishing human vs. machine translations without source documents. Objectives and scope are well-defined around classification tasks and recombining sentence-level features at the document level. Technical terms like 'translation evaluation metrics' are mentioned but not precisely defined; some jargon (e.g., domain-specific texts) is contextually clear. The structure logically flows from problem to motivation, though methods section lacks specifics on algorithms or datasets. Specificity is moderate: it specifies classification goals and features but omits details about model selection or validation. Ambiguities exist in how exactly sentence-level metrics are recombined at document level and whether source documents are entirely absent or just not required for evaluation.",

    "Rationale": "The problem is clearly stated with two distinct objectives: binary classification of paying vs non-paying users and day-30 revenue prediction using first three days' data. The scope is well-defined around these tasks, though some specifics like exact algorithms or evaluation metrics are missing. Terminology such as 'categorical and numerical data' is standard but not all terms (e.g., 'scalable') are precisely defined. The structure logically separates problem description, motivation, and objectives, though methods and expected outcomes are only briefly mentioned. Specificity could improve by detailing datasets or model selection criteria. Ambiguities exist in the exact data sources and how interpretability will be achieved.",

    "Rationale": "The problem is clearly stated with a focus on using ML to outperform traditional strategies in equity trading. Objectives and scope are well-defined, including specific algorithms (Na\u00efve Bayes, Random Forest, SVM) and the benchmark strategy based on fundamental valuation. Terminology like 'market-neutral portfolios' and 'excess returns' could be better defined, though context provides some clarity. The structure logically flows from problem to methods to expected outcomes. Specificity is strong with concrete details (S&P 500 data, transaction costs considered), but lacks specifics on exact evaluation metrics or dataset timeframe.

Objectives are well-specified, including the use of specific algorithms (neural networks, decision trees, XGBoost) and evaluation metrics (AUC, recall, precision). The structure logically flows from problem to motivation to methods. Terminology like 'non-parametric' is used without explicit definition but may be assumed based on context. Specificity is strong with a defined dataset size and scope limitations mentioned.

Technical terms like 'dynamic time warping' and 'meta-learning principles' are mentioned but not fully explained. The structure logically flows from problem to motivation to proposed method (DES-Forecasting). Specificity is good with mention of local competence identification and weighting based on recent performance, though implementation details remain vague.
