Evaluating LLM Idea Generation Capabilities in Cold-Start Domains:
    Rationale: The thesis idea of evaluating LLM idea generation capabilities in cold-start
        domains is theoretically sound and aligns with recent studies on LLMs. The
        problem description and motivation are clear, and the research gap is well-identified.
        The proposed research investigates the idea generation performance of LLMs
        in various cold-start domains and explores strategies to adapt these models
        to such settings, which is a logical and coherent approach. The methodology
        is not explicitly stated, but based on the problem description, it appears
        to be sound.
