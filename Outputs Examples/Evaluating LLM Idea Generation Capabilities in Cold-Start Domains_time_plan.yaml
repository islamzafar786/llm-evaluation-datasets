Action Plan:
- Define cold-start domains and problem scope
- Conduct literature review on LLMs in cold-start settings
- Select suitable LLM models for evaluation
- Prepare datasets for selected cold-start domains
- Design experiments to evaluate LLM idea generation capabilities
- Implement LLM model adaptation strategies
- Develop metrics for evaluating idea generation performance
- Train and fine-tune LLM models on selected datasets
- Conduct experiments and collect results
- Analyze results and identify trends
- Draw conclusions and propose future research directions
- Write and revise research paper
- Prepare presentation and conference materials
