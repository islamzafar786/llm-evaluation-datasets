Research Questions:
- Can large language models (LLMs) generate novel and relevant ideas in cold-start
    domains with limited pre-training data, and if so, how do their performance metrics
    (e.g., precision, recall, and F1-score) compare to those in well-represented domains?
- What adaptation strategies (e.g., fine-tuning, transfer learning, or data augmentation)
    can be employed to effectively leverage LLMs for idea generation in cold-start
    domains, and how do these strategies impact the models' performance?
- How do different cold-start domains (e.g., emerging technologies, niche markets,
    or underrepresented industries) affect the idea generation capabilities of LLMs,
    and are there domain-specific characteristics that influence the models' performance
    in these settings?
