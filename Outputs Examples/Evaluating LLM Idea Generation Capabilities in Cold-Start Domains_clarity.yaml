Evaluating LLM Idea Generation Capabilities in Cold-Start Domains:
    Rationale: The thesis idea clearly defines the problem of evaluating LLM idea
        generation capabilities in cold-start domains. The terminology used, such
        as 'cold-start domains' and 'LLMs', is precise and understandable. The structural
        organization is logical, with a clear problem description and motivation.
        The idea is specific in its goals and boundaries, and there is no ambiguity
        in the intent. However, some minor details about the adaptation strategies
        and evaluation methods could be further clarified.
