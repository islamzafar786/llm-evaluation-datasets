Evaluating LLM Idea Generation Capabilities in Cold-Start Domains:
    Rationale: Evaluating LLM Idea Generation Capabilities in Cold-Start Domains involves
        exploring the performance of LLMs in novel domains with minimal data. This
        research can utilize existing LLM models and potentially leverage openly available
        datasets or adapt existing ones for cold-start conditions. The computational
        requirements are moderate, as it involves running and fine-tuning LLMs, which
        can be done on a standard GPU laptop or cloud services. The theoretical complexity
        is also moderate, as it builds upon known methods but requires a good understanding
        of LLMs and their limitations. Given the scope, this project is feasible within
        a 6-month timeline with focused effort and supervision.
