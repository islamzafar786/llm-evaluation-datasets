final_summary:
    discussion: "The study provides new insights on interfaces for facet-based idea\
        \ generation and novelty assessment. The results suggest that Scideator extends\
        \ users\u2019 thinking beyond initial perspectives and helps scientists filter\
        \ unoriginal ideas. The automated evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness\
        \ of the facet-based novelty checker, which improves agreement with human\
        \ novelty ratings and outperforms recent automatic evaluation methods. The\
        \ study\u2019s findings suggest that Scideator\u2019s facet-level interaction\
        \ and scaffolding features can help researchers generate more novel and creative\
        \ ideas."
    idea: Scideator, a human-LLM interface for facet-based scientific idea generation
        and novelty evaluation, extracts key facets from input papers, retrieves analogous
        work, recombines facets to generate research ideas, and assesses their novelty
        by comparing facet combinations against existing literature. The idea is to
        develop a tool that can support both divergent and convergent ideation, and
        provide affordances for idea novelty evaluation.
    methodology: "Scideator extracts key facets\u2014purposes, mechanisms, and evaluations\u2014\
        from user-provided scientific papers and related papers, allowing users to\
        \ explore the idea space by interactively recombining facets to synthesize\
        \ inventive ideas. The system integrates electronic health records (EHRs)\
        \ with clinical guidelines, leveraging prompts to identify and follow potential\
        \ diagnostic routes. A within-subjects user study with 22 computer-science\
        \ researchers compared using Scideator versus a strong baseline for idea generation\
        \ and novelty evaluation."
    motivation: "The scientific ideation process often involves blending salient aspects\
        \ of existing papers to create new ideas \u2014 a framework known as facet-based\
        \ ideation. The ever-expanding literature makes it challenging for scientists\
        \ to discover new ideas, and cognitive fixation biases them toward familiar\
        \ thinking. This challenge has spurred interest in automated systems to assist\
        \ researchers in discovering new ideas. The motivation behind this work is\
        \ to develop a human-LLM tool that supports facet-based ideation for scientific\
        \ idea generation and novelty evaluation."
    result: "In a within-subjects user study (N=22) with computer-science researchers\
        \ comparing Scideator to a strong baseline, our tool provided significantly\
        \ more creativity support, particularly with respect to exploration and expressiveness.\
        \ Participants experienced significantly more creativity support with Scideator,\
        \ particularly in exploring different ideas. The facet-level interaction supported\
        \ creativity by providing transparency and control over the generation process.\
        \ Scideator\u2019s novelty checker helped scientists filter unoriginal ideas,\
        \ and the automated evaluation demonstrated the effectiveness of the facet-based\
        \ novelty checker."
