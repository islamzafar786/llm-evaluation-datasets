Evaluating LLM Idea Generation Capabilities in Cold-Start Domains:
    Rationale: 'The thesis idea proposes evaluating the idea generation capabilities
        of Large Language Models (LLMs) in cold-start domains. While several papers
        have explored LLMs for idea generation, the focus on cold-start domains and
        the investigation of adaptation strategies provide meaningful differentiation.
        However, the idea is somewhat similar to the paper ''IdeaBench: Benchmarking
        Large Language Models for Research Idea Generation'', which also evaluates
        LLMs for research idea generation, but in a more general context.'
